# coding-python
Pyhton challenges in the jupyter notebook are from edabit.com and range from easy to hard level (1 to 4 of 6 levels).
Challenges include algebra, arrays, maths, conditions, logic, loops, formatting, sorting, string, and some other labels. 
Unfortunately I didn't copied the challenges but all the code run okay. When I started this notebook I did not planned to upload it to GitHub,
it was meanted for praticig reasons only.

The reason I create this repository is to show that I have some coding aptitudes, although I'm possibly the only who understand this jupyter notebook,
unles the reader plays with the functions I made.

You'd probably see some functions as comments '#', that is because after completing challenges, edabit allows you to see others people way to solve the same problem,
so I copied them because I though it was an effective and simpler way to arrive to the same result.

Hope you can understand the purpose of the functions!
